Reviews you submit in this class should include the following sections:

1. Summary (short paragraph)
    In your own words, answer the following:
    - What problem does the paper address?
    - What is the main contribution of the paper? What is the key idea behind
      how it solves (part of) the problem it addresses? How is that different
      from what was done in the past?
    - Give a brief summary of approach, techniques used, results. 

2. Strengths (2 bullet points)
3. Weaknesses (2 bullet points)
4. Justification/Discussion (short paragraph)
    - Explain the strengths and weakness you listed and give your overall
      opinion of the paper. Do its strengths outweigh its weaknesses? Why or
      why not?
    - Some things to consider:
        - Is the problem new? Is it real? Is it important?
        - What assumptions does the paper make? Are those assumptions realistic?
        - Is the solution new? Is it practical? Is it better than previous
          solutions (and if so, how? is it strictly better or is there some
          tradeoff?)? Does the solution involve new techniques, or combining
          existing techniques in a new way?
        - Is the system implemented? Does the evaluation convince you that the
          authors' conclusions are correct? 

5. Discussion Points (2 bullet points): this wouldn't be included in a
   conference review, but will help guide our class meetings
    - What did you learn from the paper?
    - What questions did the paper raise for you?
    - What new ideas did the paper give you for future work? Can you think of a
      new/better solution? Is there a related problem that needs to be solved?
    - How does this paper connect to other papers you've read (either in this
      class or elsewhere)?
    - Can you use any of the ideas from the paper in your own research? 

Note: you should think carefully about the paper, but the review does not need
to be long -- one page (or less) should be sufficient.
